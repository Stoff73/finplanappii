# Implementation Summary – MVP 1.0  
_FinPlanApp II – branch `mvp-implementation`_

## 1. Scope & Goal  
The objective was to convert the **“MVP Implementation Plan”** into working code that delivers the core product loop:  

1. AI-powered chat →  
2. automatic data-extraction & DB persistence →  
3. live dashboard →  
4. PDF export.  

Guest-session auth, basic document upload and up-to-date project documentation were also in scope.

## 2. Major Deliverables  

| Area | What was added / changed | Files / Modules |
|------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **API client (FE ⇄ BE)** | Typed wrapper with token management, CRUD helpers, health-check & upload endpoint. | `src/services/apiClient.js` |
| **Document Processing** | Lightweight service to accept uploads, simulate extraction, detect doc types, summarise results & feed the extractor. | `src/services/documentProcessing.js` |
| **PDF Generation** | Full jsPDF/html2canvas pipeline, section toggling, progress bar & UX. Downloaded locally; configurable footer/disclaimer. | `src/services/pdfGenerator.js` and UI in `components/PDF/PDFExport.jsx` |
| **Pages / UI** | • Hero + feature-grid Home  <br>• Rich Export page  <br>• Updated routing in `App.js` | `src/pages/Home.jsx`, `src/pages/Export.jsx` |
| **Styling** | Centralised custom CSS utilities & component patterns (cards, buttons, progress bars…). | `src/App.css` |
| **Env & Docs** | Sample envs, exhaustive README, `.env.example`, `.env.local` (git-ignored). | new files |
| **Prisma migration** | Kept schema, added timestamped migration record & fresh `dev.db`. | `prisma/migrations/20250531100026_init/…` |
| **Branch & Commits** | New branch `mvp-implementation`, commits 92042c3, 8581c82. | – |

_All added files compile without ESLint blocking errors and all routes pass manual Postman smoke tests._

## 3. Approach & Reasoning  

1. **Backend first checks** – confirmed routes, schema & guest token flow were functional; regenerated migration & seed.  
2. **Thin Frontend–Backend contract** – introduced `apiClient` early so every feature shares the same fetch logic.  
3. **Incremental delivery** following the plan’s four phases; each feature was functional before styling polish.  
4. **Offline-friendly** – OpenAI key is optional; chat falls back to deterministic responses, PDF export never calls external APIs.  
5. **UX parity with plan** – all MVP buttons, states and completion gating (≥30 % for export) match the spec.  
6. **Clean-up** – obsolete BMAD files & initial migration removed to keep branch light.

## 4. Key Considerations & Challenges  

| Topic | Notes / Mitigation |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Missing FE API wrapper** | Created `apiClient`; all context hooks now call it, enabling JWT/header reuse. |
| **Large data-extraction service** | Left algorithm unchanged to minimise risk; new services compose around it. |
| **PDF pagination & quality** | Tuned dynamic page heights, split content & added universal footer with disclaimer. |
| **Env secrets in Git** | `.env.*` patterns already in `.gitignore`; provided `.env.example` for clarity. |
| **Prisma & SQLite locking** | SQLite journal committed; dev concurrency OK but flagged for Prod migration. |
| **UI size & Tailwind** | Broke out utility classes in `App.css` to avoid Tailwind config bloat; still tree-shakable. |

## 5. What’s Ready vs. Deferred  

### Fully Implemented (MVP 1.0)  
- Guest auth & session persistence  
- Goal selection driving context & progress score  
- Chat → extraction → Prisma save  
- Dashboard cards & progress bar  
- Basic doc upload with summary & optional ingest  
- Configurable PDF export  

### Deferred / Simplified  
- Full user registration & hashed passwords  
- Live OpenAI calls behind real key (supported but optional)  
- Responsive fine-tuning for very small devices  
- Advanced analytics charts  
- Real OCR/CSV parsing (mocked for demo)  

---

## 6. Next Steps (MVP 1.1 roadmap)  
1. Secure user accounts & password flow.  
2. Replace simulated doc parsing with proper parsers (pdf.js, mammoth, papaparse).  
3. Add websocket notifications for AI typing and long running tasks.  
4. Finetuned GPT system prompts & multi-agent architecture (re-introduce BMAD assets).  
5. CI pipeline for lint/test/build and automatic Prisma migration check.
