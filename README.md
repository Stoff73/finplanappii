## 1. Project Overview
FinPlan II is a full-stack demo showing how conversational AI and modern web tech can automate the **fact-find â†’ analysis â†’ plan** flow for UK households.

The app lets a user (or guest) simply *talk* about income, expenses, goals etc.  
Extracted data is persisted to a SQLite database, visualised in a React dashboard, and can be exported as a PDF plan.  

The codebase is split into:

| Layer     | Location      | Summary |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Frontend  | `src/`        | React SPA with Tailwind styling & React-Router navigation |
| Backend   | `server/`     | Node + Express REST API with JWT auth |
| Database  | `prisma/`     | Prisma schema & migrations targeting SQLite |
| Services  | `src/services/` | Data-extraction, OpenAI client, API client, PDF generator, document processing |

## 3. Tech Stack & Architecture
- **React 19**, React-Router 6, Context API for global state
- **Tailwind CSS 3** utility-first styling
- **Lucide-React** icon set, **Recharts** for simple charts
- **Node 18 + Express 5** REST API (`/api/*`)
- **Prisma 4** ORM with **SQLite** (file-based) for quickest local start
- **JWT + bcrypt** for auth (guest or full user)
- **OpenAI Chat Completions** (GPT-4) via `src/services/openai.js`
- **jsPDF + html2canvas** for PDF generation

## 4. Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node >= 18
- npm >= 9

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/finplanappii.git
cd finplanappii
npm install           # installs both root & client deps
```

*(The backend lives in `server/` but its dependencies are already declared in the root `package.json` so one install is enough.)*

### Database & Migrations

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # adjust values
npm run db:migrate     # prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed        # optional sample data
```

### Run Development Servers (concurrently)

```bash
npm run dev            # runs:  nodemon server  +  react-scripts start
# React: http://localhost:3000
# API : http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## 5. Configuration & Environment Variables

| Var | Purpose | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `PORT` | Backend port | `3001` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Prisma connection | `file:./dev.db` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Sign tokens | `something-super-secret` |
| `REACT_APP_API_URL` | Frontend â†’ API base | `http://localhost:3001/api` |
| `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional â€“ enables live GPT replies | `sk-...` |

If `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` is **omitted** the app falls back to deterministic offline prompts.

## 6. Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/xyz
   ```
2. **Run both servers** `npm run dev`
3. Any server change triggers nodemon restart; any client change triggers hot-reload.
4. Commit following Conventional Commits.
5. Open a PR â†’ Automatic lint/test will run.

### Linting & Formatting
- ESLint config inherited from `react-app`.
- Tailwind class order checked via Prettier plugin (optional).

### Tests
```bash
npm test    # React Testing Library + Jest
```
